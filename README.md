One want to generate efficiently all words of length n over a fixed alphabet {1, ..., k} but up to any permutation of the letter. This means, we donâ€™t want to generate 112, 113 and 332 : there are al equivalents up to permutation of the letters. We need only one of them. This way, one can win close to a factor factorial (k).

Is this possible ??

Possile generation with k! 


Algorithms 1 and 2 are an application of the theorem of combination with repeation.

Algorithms 3 an application of my demonstration of weakly increasing(combination repeation).
